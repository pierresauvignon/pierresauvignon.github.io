<h1>Hello, I’m Pierre/h1>

<p>I’m a French entrepreneur who loves the Internet. I started my first venture fresh out of high school – at a time where Internet access <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aol+cd" title="AOL CD" target="_blank">came in the mail</a> – and I haven’t stopped since!</p>

<p>While graduating from my Masters of IT I decided to move to Australia and I started to work for a couple of Sydney based startups. One thing led to another and in 2008 I was fortunate enough to join <a href="http://pollenizer.com/author/mick-liubinskas" title="Mick Liubinskas" target="_blank">Mick</a>, <a href="http://pollenizer.com/author/phil-morle" title="Phil Morle" target="_blank">Phil</a> and <a href="au.linkedin.com/in/jonathantyson" title="Jon Tyson" target="_blank">Jon</a> in the very early days of <a href="http://pollenizer.com/" title="Pollenizer" target="_blank">Pollenizer</a>. I spent 5 years working with a team of fantastic people and together we’ve built Australia’s first web incubator and had the privilege to help over a hundred startups.</p>

<p>I am now an investor in <a href="http://pollenizer.com/investors" target="_blank">Pollenizer Holdings</a> and <a href="http://pollenizer.com/investors" target="_blank">Pollenizer Global</a> with a portfolio of about 20 startups, 3 of which are now profitable companies.</p>

<p>In 2013 my partner Rachel and I moved back to France to enjoy the tranquility of the south of France. In my spare time I do what I can to help local startups. I can be reached on my gmail (pierre.sauvignon) or on <a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_s" title="Pierre Sauvignon Twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I also blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@pierre_s">Medium</a> from time to time.</p>
