			<h1>Hello, I’m Pierre</h1>

			<p>I’m a French entrepreneur who started his first venture fresh out of high school – at a time where Internet access <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=aol+cd" title="AOL CD" target="_blank">came in the mail</a> – and I haven’t stopped since!</p>

			<p>While graduating from my Masters of IT I decided to move to Australia and started to work for a couple of Sydney based startups. One thing led to another and in 2008 I was fortunate enough to join <a href="http://pollenizer.com/author/mick-liubinskas" title="Mick Liubinskas" target="_blank">Mick</a>, <a href="http://pollenizer.com/author/phil-morle" title="Phil Morle" target="_blank">Phil</a> and <a href="au.linkedin.com/in/jonathantyson" title="Jon Tyson" target="_blank">Jon</a> in the very first days of <a href="http://pollenizer.com/" title="Pollenizer" target="_blank">Pollenizer</a>.</p> 

			<p>I've spent 5 years working at Pollenizer with a team of fantastic people and together we’ve built Australia’s first and biggest web incubator. Over the years we've helped grow more than a hundred startups and we've co-founded about 30 businesses. We've had more failures than I can count... and we learned from them, created the "Startup Science" and even wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Focus-Mick-Liubinskas/dp/0980809746/" target="_blank">a book</a> to share our learnings. Thankfully we also had our successes! One of our ventures <a href="http://anthillonline.com/spreets-sold-for-40-million-in-the-biggest-and-fastest-group-buying-deal-of-the-year-so-far/" target="_blank">sold to Yahoo for AU$40M</a> and 3 of our businesses are now profitable companies.</p>

			<p>In 2013 it was time for me to move on (while remaining an investor in <a href="http://pollenizer.com/investors" target="_blank">Pollenizer Holdings</a> and <a href="http://pollenizer.com/investors" target="_blank">Pollenizer Global</a>) and my wife Rachel and I decided to moved back to France to enjoy the tranquility of the south of France. </p>

			<p>In my spare time I do what I can to help local startups. I can be reached on my gmail (pierre.sauvignon) or on <a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_s" title="Pierre Sauvignon Twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I also blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@pierre_s" target="_blank">Medium</a> from time to time.</p>
