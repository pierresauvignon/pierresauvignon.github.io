      	<section id="About">

			<p>I’m an entrepreneur specialised in Product Management & Strategy. I started my first venture fresh out of high school – at a time where Internet access <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=aol+cd&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X" title="AOL CD" target="_blank">came in the mail</a> – and I haven’t stopped since!</p>

		</section>

		<section id="Curriculum">

			<p>While graduating from my Masters of IT I decided to move to Australia and started to work for a couple of Sydney based startups. One thing led to another and in 2008 I was fortunate enough to join <a href="http://pollenizer.com/author/mick-liubinskas" title="Mick Liubinskas" target="_blank">Mick</a>, <a href="http://pollenizer.com/author/phil-morle" title="Phil Morle" target="_blank">Phil</a> and <a href="au.linkedin.com/in/jonathantyson" title="Jon Tyson" target="_blank">Jon</a> in the very first days of <a href="http://pollenizer.com/" title="Pollenizer" target="_blank">Pollenizer</a>.</p> 

		</section>

		<section id="Experience">

			<p>I've then spent 5 years working at Pollenizer with a team of fantastic people and together we’ve built Australia’s first and biggest web incubator. Over the years we've helped grow more than a hundred startups and we've co-founded about 30 businesses. We've had more failures than I can count... and we learned from them, conceptualised what is now known as the "Startup Science" and wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Focus-Mick-Liubinskas/dp/0980809746/" target="_blank">a book</a> to share our learnings. Thankfully we also had some successes! One of our ventures <a href="http://anthillonline.com/spreets-sold-for-40-million-in-the-biggest-and-fastest-group-buying-deal-of-the-year-so-far/" target="_blank">sold to Yahoo for AU$40M</a> and 3 of our businesses are now profitable companies.</p>

		<section id="TheBreak">

			<p>In 2013 I needed to take a break and while remaining an investor in Pollenizer Holdings and Pollenizer Global I moved back to the south of France to enjoy the tranquility of life in the heart of wine country. But I guess I wasn’t quite ready for retirement yet ;) In 2015 I joined <a href="http://www.evergiving.com/" target="_blank">Evergiving</a> (a Pollenizer alumni) as a Product Manager/Designer and helped the team transition its products, branding and design over a brand new platform.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="Lately">
			<p>At the end of 2016 I decided to move back to Sydney where I freelanced as a startup coach. Fast forward a couple of years later and my wife and I moved to Perth where I joined a big corporate (a first for me :)): <a href="https://rac.com.au/">RAC</a>. There my job was to incubate internal businesses under their strategic innovation arm. I came up with <a href="https://heyscape.com.au">Heyscape</a>, a provider of off grid accomodations in "tiny cabins" across exclusive private locations in Western Australia. I grew the business from idea to profitability 4 years later with 25 cabins on 7 awesome locations. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKadr02tapA">the brand story</a> to see the cabins, locations and me wearing a buttoned up shirt (rare! ;)).</p>
		</section>

		<section id="now">
			After 4 years at Heyscape it was time for me to move on to the next challenge. While busy building Heyscape my wife and I also decided to start a family. We now have succesfully incubated and launched 2 new little ventures who've certainly reshaped our lives :) In order for us to support them the best we could we decided to start our own business. Launching in 2024. TBC!
