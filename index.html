			<h1>Hi, I’m Pierre</h1>

      	<section id="About">

			<p>I started my first venture fresh out of high school—back when Internet access <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=aol+cd&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X" title="AOL CD" target="_blank">came in the mail</a>—and I haven’t stopped since.</p>

		</section>

		<section id="Curriculum">

			<p>Originally from France, I moved to Australia while finishing a Masters of IT and jumped into Sydney’s startup scene. In 2008 I joined Pollenizer in its earliest days.</p>

		</section>

		<section id="Experience">

			<p>Over the next five years, our team built Australia’s first and biggest web incubator—helping launch 100+ startups and co-founding ~30 businesses. We had plenty of failures (and learned a lot), codified what became the “Startup Science,” and even wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Focus-Mick-Liubinskas/dp/0980809746/" target="_blank">a book</a> to share it. We also had wins: one venture <a href="http://anthillonline.com/spreets-sold-for-40-million-in-the-biggest-and-fastest-group-buying-deal-of-the-year-so-far/" target="_blank">sold to Yahoo!7 for AU$40M</a>, and several others became profitable companies.</p>

		</section>

		<section id="TheBreak">

			<p>In 2013 I took a breather in the south of France. In 2015 I joined <a href="https://www.evergiving.com/" target="_blank">Evergiving</a> (a Pollenizer alumni) as Product Manager/Designer to lead a platform, brand and design refresh.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="Lately">
			<p>At the end of 2016 I moved back to Sydney to coach startups. A little later my wife and I relocated to Perth, where I joined <a href="https://rac.com.au/" target="_blank">RAC</a> to incubate new ventures within its innovation arm. That’s where I created <a href="https://heyscape.com.au" target="_blank">Heyscape</a>—off-grid tiny-cabin stays across exclusive Western Australian locations. I grew it from idea to profitability in four years, reaching 25 cabins across 7 sites. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKadr02tapA" target="_blank">the brand story</a> to see the cabins, locations and me wearing a buttoned-up shirt (rare!).</p>
		</section>

		<section id="theNow">
			<p>After four years at Heyscape it was time for a new challenge. Along the way my wife and I also launched two little “startups” at home (kids!). To support this next chapter, we’re building a new venture: <a href="https://onsilent.com" target="_blank">OnSilent</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>OnSilent</strong> turns your voicemail into a 24/7 AI call assistant—automatically transcribing messages, summarising caller intent, prioritising what matters, and filtering spam so you get hours back each week. It works with your existing number, sets up quickly, and comes with a free trial. If you live in your phone (sales, property, trades, services), it’s like hiring a receptionist who never sleeps. Try it at <a href="https://onsilent.com" target="_blank">onsilent.com</a> or grab the iOS app.</p>
